# env
This directory contains `.env` files needed for configuration of the client and server.

The client uses the `env/client.env` file by default (may be changed with the `-e` flag). The file `client_example.env` provides an example of configuration.

The server uses the `env/server.env` file by default (may be changed with the `-e` flag). The file `server_example.env` provides an example of configuration.
